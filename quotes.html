        <h3>Quantum Internet</h3>
        <p>Imagine being millions of miles away and wanting to share huge important piece of information in an hour or two. Woah, that sounds difficult with current technologies. But Quantum Internet is a way of communication to connect distant machines that can transfer information faster than your imagination. Maybe a time comes when it surpasses the speed of light. Despite significant unresolved engineering challenges experts predict a global quantum network will be online by 2030. This is a great news for all people who are interested in quantum technology.In quantum world data is encoded in state of qubits which can be made in quantum computers or processors. A quantum network can send these qubits across various quantum devices which are separated physically. One of advanatges of using quantum internet is the security of data thus providing safer modes of communications all over the globe. </p>

            <h3>Quantum Shuttle: Traffic Navigation</h3>
            <p>Hehe sounds like using quantum shuttle to traverse through traffic. Well, not really but yea there are more interesting things when we use quantum computational methodologies for traffic navigation in transportation.There are millions of vehicles around the world and encountering traffic has become a daily routine be it a festival or just a normal day. Huh? isn't there any solution to this. Well there might be something in quantum. Using quantum computer to decode the shortest and minimal traffic area can be done. But how is it different from classical computer then? Haha well that's the realm of quantum . It makes things easier without us knowing how. ANd this confusion would stay. You might be wondering how we can do this. ER models from graph theory can be solved using quantum computers where nodes in ER graph represents destination and edges represents routes. Wanna know more? You can always write to me. Will be updating more on this soon. </p>

                <h3>Arduino Meets Quantum Computer </h3>
                <p>Connecting an arduino to quantum computer. Sounds interesting isn't it? What is the use of doing this. Well, its an experiment and why not try something whose outcome we don't know at all. Maybe arduino getting connected to quantum computer improves the accuracy of information. Or maybe the code runs at a much faster rate. Some amazing things might come up. Using the IBM quantum computer and the open source Qiskit makes it relatively easy, with the Python code acting as a link between the Arduino and the IBM computer. But I am more interested in trying this over Xanadu borelais the recently launched photonic quantum computer.I'll soon update how my experiment on borealis and arduino was. Stay tuned.</p>
